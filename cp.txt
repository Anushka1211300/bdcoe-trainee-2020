Q)
Consider an -element array, , where each index  in the array contains a reference to an array of  integers (where the value of  varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given , you must answer  queries. Each query is in the format i j, where  denotes an index in array  and  denotes an index in the array located at . For each query, find and print the value of element  in the array at location  on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.
