GIT

1) Git is a Version Control System. Git manages our changes in files. 
2) We can install it in our system, start coding and push our code in your repository, keep making changes to our source files.
3) Through this, multiple people can work on same file. 
4) It enables transparency in the team and everyone can view who made what changes.
5) Repository is just a storage space for your source files.
6) Git allows you to commit a code throughout the development process, each commits works as a check point. 
7) So whenever we feel like you have messed up with something, or just we want to do a disposal experiment you revert to any commit
