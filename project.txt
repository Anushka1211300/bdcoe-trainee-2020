completed my project.
Project name-Face recognition attendence system
In my program i have implemented some concepts of machine learning

25 aug/2020=>Started a project (website for bdcoe) 
30aug/2020=>Due to some reasons changed my project as i was attracted more towards machine learning
after knowing by the seniors about it as in web dev I only studied html and css so I shifted to machine learning.
Finalised my project Face recognition attendence sysrtem for BDCOE.
1sep/2020=>Started studying about machine learning as the topic was very vast
and i was not able to learn things in one month time span so jumped directly on my projects.
with the help of seniors came to know about the modulesthat will be used in my project
and started working on  them.
Modules used
1) Open cv->Basic module for computer vision
2)Numpy->Used in some mathematicals operations like converted my image in array for calculation.
3)Tkinter->For GUI
4)OS->used this for importing some photos from directory
5)mysql->used this for storing data

Algorithm used->LBPH(Local Binary Pattern Histogram)

24 sep/2020=> Uploaded my project on bdcoe2020trainees. I push my work even before on github but that was on my repository but now I have pushed all my work on bdcoe repo.
Thank You
