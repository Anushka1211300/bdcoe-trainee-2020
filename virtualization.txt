VIRTUALIZATION:

	Virtualization means creating virtual copies of something.
It means making multiple copies of the same instance.
	Using virtualization, we are able to distribute a machine's capability
among many users or environment.
	
	For virtualization to work, softwares called hypervisers are used.
They separate the physical resources from the virtual environment.

	There are two types of hypervisers:
		Type 1 and Type 2
		
	Type 1: It runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware.
			It doesn't have to load an underlying OS first.
			
	Type 2: It is typically installed on top of an existing OS.
			It relies on the host machine's pre-existing OS.
